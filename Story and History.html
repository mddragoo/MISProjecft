<p> <center> <font face="Arial",font size="3",font color="white"> Tracy and Tom’s Total Travel is a family run company that has been serving customers for <i> <b><font face="Arial",font size="3",font color="red"> 25 years</i> </b>. </font> The founders, Tracy and Tom Smith, are siblings that grew up in West Lafayette, IN. They grew up with a huge passion to see the world and since have traveled all around the world. In their adventures they have traveled to over 25 cities around the globe where they dove into various culture’s people, food, traditions, beliefs, etc. During their travels however, they often found that it was hard to constantly try to find a new place to get all their information, directions, and products that they needed for all this traveling. With this they created Tracy and Tom’s Total Travel to put all these items in one place for fellow travelers to have easy access to everything that they need for their adventures around the world. Below you can see the various places that Tracy and Tom have traveled as well as their good friend, Ken Kaminsky’s blog where he posts pictures from all their travels together.  </center> </font>
